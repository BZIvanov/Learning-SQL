      <h2>ACID principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Atomicity - indivisible and irreducible series of database operations.
          Basically it represents a transaction. It means that when running a
          transaction either all operations in the transaction should succeed or
          all should be reverted if one of the operations fail (all or nothing).
        </li>
        <li>
          Consistency - changes to the database allowed from on valid state to
          another. It means that the data should be consistent after the
          transaction is completed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Isolation - when and how the changes we made become visible to the
          others. It means that transactions should be kept from each other
          until they are finished.
        </li>
        <li>
          Durability - committed changes become permanent. It means that the
          database is guaranteed to keep track of pending changes in such a way,
          that the server can recover from an abnormal termination.
        </li>
