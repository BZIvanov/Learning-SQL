# SQL (Structured Query Language)

**SQL** is a programming language used to manage and interact with relational databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data using commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

**DBMS (Database Management System)** refers to the software that handles the storage, retrieval, and management of data in a database.

Examples of popular **relational DBMSs** (RDBMS) include:

- **MySQL**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **SQLite**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **Oracle Database**

These systems implement SQL, but may include additional features or slightly different syntax.

In short:

- **SQL** is the language.
- **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, etc., are **systems** that understand and execute SQL commands.
