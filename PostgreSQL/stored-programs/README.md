# Stored programs

Focus on **user-defined and procedural logic**.

- **Stored Procedures**: These are blocks of code stored in the database and executed with the CALL statement. They **can perform transactions** (e.g., `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).
- **Stored Functions**: Similar to procedures but **return a value** and are often used in queries. They cannot manage transactions directly.

- In **pgAdmin**, you can find your procedures under: `Schemas → public → Procedures`
- In **pgAdmin**, you can find your functions under: `Schemas → public → Functions`
